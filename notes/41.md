Use `setTimeout(callback, time(ms))` method to set a timeout, which is a globally-available method

`setInterval(callback, time(ms))` will run the callback every unit of time

`setInterval` won't run immediately, but only start the "clock" once the fist unit of time has passed. 

To stop timers from running, you first have to save reference to it in a variable, then call `clearTimeout` on that variable. There's no other way to do this.
